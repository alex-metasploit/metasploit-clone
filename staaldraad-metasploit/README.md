Just some metasploit modules and plugins. 
-------------------------------------------

* __enum_domain_user.rb__ is a post exploit module that allows you to enumerate the current network for locations where a target user is logged in.

* __get_hosts.rb__ a post exploit module to retrieve a list of all hosts on the network. Basically 'net view' in meterpreter.

* __history.rb__ a msfconsole plugin to keep track of recently executed commands and play these back, in a similar manner to bash.
