#
# Your machine must have a route to the internet as a prerequisite to running this script.
# If you experience difficulties, you may create a log file by running this script like this: ./script.sh 2>&1 | tee script.log
#
# Homebrew now installs MSF, so you may wish to try that ('brew install metasploit') first.
